# gulp_base_template

This is my starter template for my projects.  Uses Gulp to do all the compiling of SASS and Javascript, as well as optimize any images added to the 'src/imgs' folder. 

It includes the following, which are loaded when npm & bower install are run:
- Gulp
- Modernizr
- Normalize.css v4
